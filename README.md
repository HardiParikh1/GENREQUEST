# GENREQUEST

Led the design and development of GenreQuest, a web-based application revolutionizing book exploration and engagement. 
Utilized user-centred design principles, Figma for prototype, and integrated features like book buying and selling options and interactive discussions. Created an intuitive and immersive reading experience for users.
